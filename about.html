     <h2>Major</h2><p>I recently changed my major Computer Science B.S.  Why....? Growing up, I've always loved Sciences and Mathematics was by far my favorite discipline, where I had my best grades. Then respectively Physics and Biology. Therefore I was planning on majoring in Math at URI after my highschool in France. However I wasn't sure where a Math major would lead me and I did not feel like teaching math. So I ended up majoring in Biology as my parents "advised me". As I was progressively losing interest in all my BIO required classes; I found out about another major much closer to what I love: Math, Computers, Programing and so on...</p>

     <h2>Academic Grade</h3><p>I was majoring in Biology as a Freshman and Sophomore. I'm an incoming Junior.</p></td>

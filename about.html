     <h2>Major</h2><p>I recently changed my major Computer Science B.S.  Why....? Growing up, I've always loved Sciences and Mathematics was by far my favorite discipline, where I had my best grades. Then respectively Physics and Biology. Therefore I was planning on majoring in Math at URI after my highschool in France. However I wasn't sure where a Math major would lead me and I did not feel like teaching math. So I ended up majoring in Biology as my parents "advised me". As I was progressively losing interest in all my BIO required classes; I found out about another major much closer to what I love: Math, Computers, Programing and so on...</p>

     <h2>Academic Grade</h3><p>I was majoring in Biology as a Freshman and Sophomore. I'm an incoming Junior.</p></td>

    <td><h2>Future plans</h2><p>I had NO idea on what I wanted to do after completing my studies but I made a step forward.<br>Because now I DO NOT know! The thing is my ideas are so vast that I can't decide yet: Cyber Security from Michael Alssid or even Software Developer, Technical Analysis  from Professor Armenti, all already caught my interest.<br>Hopefully as I am studying, I'll be able to see clearly what I want to do after completing my studies.</p>

    <td> <h2>Unique?</h2><p>Something unique about me could be that I've traveled quite a lot, even though "a lot" is relative to an average and the perception of each individual. I've been to many different countries such as the United States of America, France, Martinique, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Italy, Cameroon, Benin and Canada. Without mentioning the travels from inside each country.<br>Another unique thing would be that I've been communicating in English for 2 years.  Basically, I started one semester before my Freshman year.</p></td>

   <td colspan="2"> <h2>Hobbies</h5> <p>I like watching animes, listening to music and playing some online video games but I rather only spend my days studying and playing basketball because I enjoy it too <strong>and</strong> it brings me closer to where I want to be.
   <br>I also cook my own food<br><table align="center"><tr><td><img src="food1.png" alt=“rice with white sauce and salmon” width="150" height="150"><img src="food2.png" alt=“fried plantain and eggs” width="150" height="150"><img src="food3.png" alt=“Crepes with nutella” width="150" height="150"></td></tr></table></p></td>
